I am Karish Grover. I am a senior undergraduate at [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), India, pursuing [Computer Science and Artifical Intelligence](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/btech/csai). My interests lie in Natural Language Processing, Graph Machine Learning, Explainable Deep Learning and Hyperbolic Geometry.

I am a member of the [Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2)](https://www.lcs2.in/), where I am working on my undergraduate thesis, advised by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://www.tanmoychak.com/) and [Dr. Md. Shad Akhtar](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~shad.akhtar/). Previously, I have also worked at [LinkedIn](https://about.linkedin.com/) as a Machine Learning intern, where I worked as a part of the Misinformation and Virality detection team. I have also been fortunate enough to work with [Dr. Mukesh Mohania](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/mukesh), [Dr. Vikram Goyal](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/vikram), [Dr. Radhika Mamidi](https://sites.google.com/site/radhika41), and [Dr. Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/). I am always looking forward to working on cool projects. *Hit me up*, if you wish to collaborate!
