I am a Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), advised by [Prof. Christos Faloutsos](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/) and [Prof. Geoffrey J. Gordon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/). My research interests lie in graph machine learning, representation learning, and explainable deep learning.


I have interned at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/locations/san-francisco-bay-area) Science (AWS), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) Research and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) AI. Prior to joining CMU, I graduated from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) (in June 2023), with a Bachelor's in [Computer Science and Artifical Intelligence](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/btech/csai). At IIIT, I was a member of the [Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2)](https://www.lcs2.in/), where I worked on my undergraduate thesis, advised by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://www.tanmoychak.com/). I am always looking forward to working on cool projects. *Hit me up*, if you wish to collaborate!
