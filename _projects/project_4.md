Social media has become a necessitous part of people's lives. Users can interact, express their views, comment on others' views, and access news through various social media platforms. Some people make unjust use of these mediums to spread misinformation. As fake news pieces are intentionally created to spread inaccurate information and lure people into believing them, they often have opinionated and sensational language styles, which can help verify the integrity of the news piece. In addition, a news document contains linguistic cues at different levels, such as word-level and sentence-level, which provide different degrees of importance for the explainability of why the news is fake.

For example, consider an unreliable news piece, Iranian woman jailed for a fictional unpublished story about a woman stoned to death for adultery. The words jailed and fictional contributes more to deciding whether the news claim is fake or not, as compared to the other words in the sentence. Further, as shown in the above figure, the highlighted words are more crucial towards the final prediction as compared to the others parts of the news piece as they give more information about the writing style of the news piece.
