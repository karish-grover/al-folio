title: ExPoseNet:- Expression and Orientation Aware Unmasking
summary: <ul class="card-text"><li> This work proposes a solution for expression- and orientation-aware facial unmasking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate unmasked faces while preserving the personâ€™s emotions and facial orientation. <li></li>We propose a novel GAN-based approach, enhanced with <b markdown = "1">`Fourier convolutions`</b> to generate a high-resolution unmasked image.</li><li>Further, we propose a <b markdown = "1">`dilated-convolutional refinement module`</b> that enhances the decoder output quality, to remove noise from the generated image.</li></ul>
