title: Hierarchical Conv. Attention Network for Fake News Det.
summary: <ul class="card-text"><li> Verifying the integrity of a particular piece of news is not easy for any end-user. In this work, our end goal is to design an efficient model to examine the <b>reliability of a news piece</b>. </li><li>This paper addresses the problem of Fake News classification, given only the news piece content and the author name. </li><li>We present, <b markdown = "1">`Hierarchical Convolutional-Attention Network (HCAN)`</b> composed of attention-enhanced word-level and sentence-level encoders and a CNN to capture the sequential correlation.</li></ul>
